### Terminal ball bouncing in Rust

I'm learning Rust, this is a small and fun project just to challenge myself.

It works!

What I feel I could do next (in order of complexity):

- ~random initial ball position and velocity~ done in `v0.2.0`
- several balls at the same time
- accept CLI arguments (clap or structopt)
- variable board size
- configurable ball char and color
- make the balls leave a trail
- walls and other obstacles inside the board 
- make the balls collide with each other
- balls of different shapes (n x m chars)

Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
